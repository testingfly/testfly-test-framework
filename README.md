# Testfly

## Overview

This Java-based API testing framework is designed to streamline the process of testing APIs while leveraging the power of Excel as a data source. With a focus on simplicity and efficiency, this framework is data-driven, making it easy to set up and run tests quickly.

## Features

- **Data-Driven Testing**: Utilizes Excel as a data source for storing test cases and input data, making it easy to manage and update test scenarios.

- **Simplified Setup**: Setting up and running tests is straightforward and user-friendly, even for those new to API testing.

- **Robust Reporting**: The framework offers comprehensive reporting capabilities, including support for generating both PDF and HTML reports, helping you easily interpret and share test results.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the Excel-Based Java API Testing Framework:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine.

2. **Prerequisites**: Ensure that you have Java installed on your system.

3. **Configuration**: Update the configuration files to specify the API endpoints and other settings necessary for your tests.

4. **Create Test Cases**: Use Excel to create test cases, specifying input data and expected outcomes.

5. **Execute Tests**: Run the tests, and the framework will fetch data from the Excel files and execute the API requests.

6. **Review Reports**: After the tests are complete, review the reports generated in both PDF and HTML formats to analyze the test results.

## Reporting

The framework automatically generates reports in PDF and HTML formats, making it easy to share the results with your team or stakeholders. Reports include details on test execution, pass/fail status, and any error messages encountered during testing.
